# TASK-003A: Comprehensive Tool Comparison Methodologies and Evaluation Frameworks

**Research conducted for TASK-003A**

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research into current industry practices and academic frameworks, this document establishes a systematic methodology for comparing codebase navigation tools with particular focus on Native Claude tools versus MCP CodeGraph server capabilities. The framework combines quantitative performance metrics with qualitative usability assessments, following industry standards like DORA metrics and SPACE framework while addressing gaps specific to code navigation tool evaluation.

### Key Takeaways
- Industry has standardized on DORA metrics and SPACE framework for developer productivity measurement
- Mixed-method evaluation approaches provide the most comprehensive tool assessment
- Time-to-discovery and accuracy metrics are critical for practical tool comparison
- AI-enhanced tools show mixed productivity results depending on developer experience and context
- Standardized benchmarks are essential for objective tool comparison

## Supervisor-Orchestrator Compliance (Conductor-First)

This evaluation adheres to repository governance and supervisor policy: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/conductor-delegation-policy.md`, and conductor rules (`conductor.md`).

- Conductor-first: route all multi-step comparison work via the Conductor/Orchestrator
- Complexity gate: classify this program as complexity > 5 â†’ require method proposals, risk assessment, and explicit approvals before execution
- TASK/ADR discipline: reference `TASK-003A` in logs; raise an ADR for any architectural change or dependency addition
- Safety guardrails: respect CPU/memory limits; use staged rollouts; prefer reversible changes; destructive operations require ADR + explicit approval
- Logging/telemetry: use structured categories (SYSTEM, MCP_REQUEST, MCP_RESPONSE, MCP_ERROR, AGENT_ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE) with request IDs and timings; store run artifacts under `logs_llm/`

## 10. Instrumentation and Telemetry

### Logging Categories and IDs
- Use SYSTEM, MCP_REQUEST, MCP_RESPONSE, MCP_ERROR, AGENT_ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE
- Include `session_id`, `run_id`, `participant_id`, `task_id`, `tool_name`
- Persist JSONL to `logs_llm/evals/TASK-003A/YYYYMMDD/session-<session_id>.jsonl`

### Run Record Schema (JSON)
```json
{
  "run_id": "uuid",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "participant_id": "anon-###",
  "tool": "NativeClaude | MCP_CodeGraph",

}
```

### Data Quality Checks
- Validate monotonic timestamps and non-negative durations
- Cross-check task ground-truth to compute precision/recall
- Flag outliers (>3Ïƒ) for review; annotate or exclude pre-registered

## 11. Scoring and Decision Matrix

### Weighted Criteria
- Accuracy (precision/recall/F1): 35%
- Time-to-discovery / completion: 25%
- Coverage of relationships/features: 15%
- Developer experience (SUS/NASA-TLX): 15%
- Integration/automation fit: 10%

### Decision Rules
- Adoption threshold: weighted score difference â‰¥ 0.10 in favor of winner
- Non-inferiority: accuracy not worse by > 2 percentage points
- Guardrail: error rate and incident count must not increase

## 12. Bias Control and Participant Design

- Counterbalance tool order per participant (Latin square)
- Warm-up tasks to reduce learning effects; record familiarity
- Segment analysis by experience level (novice/intermediate/expert)
- Train/test task separation to avoid leakage

## 13. Datasets and Benchmark Tasks

### Corpora
- Synthetic ground-truth repo: seeded call graphs, cross-file relations, duplicates
- Real-world TS/JS repo: medium size (5kâ€“20k LOC), typical web/service patterns

### Task Bank (examples)
- T001 Method discovery: locate `foo()` implementation and all overloads
- T002 Relationship traversal: list callers of `parseConfig` up to depth 2
- T003 Semantic search: find code that "debounces API requests"
- T004 Cross-reference: enumerate write-sites to `user.profile.email`
- T005 Similarity: identify duplicate JSON parsing utilities

## 14. Risk, Safety, and Rollout

- Resource limits: enforce CPU/memory ceilings; throttle concurrency; abort gracefully
- Incident handling: timeouts â†’ recovery per `SYSTEM_HANG_RECOVERY_PLAN.md`
- Staged rollout: pilot (n=5) â†’ limited (n=15) â†’ full (nâ‰¥30)
- Reversibility: keep previous tool paths available during transition

## 15. Data Management and Reporting

- Storage: `logs_llm/evals/TASK-003A/` with daily subfolders; JSONL + summary CSV
- Privacy: anonymize participant IDs; store consent separately
- Reporting: executive summary, methods, results, limitations, recommendations

## 16. Critical System Stability Issues (URGENT)

### ðŸš¨ **EMBEDDING INITIALIZATION CRASH PATTERN**

**Root Cause Identified**: Infinite recursive embedding model initialization causing system crashes:

**Evidence**:
- Location: `src/semantic/embedding-generator.ts:32-34`
- Pattern: Failed env access â†’ retry initialization â†’ failed env access â†’ infinite loop
- Log signature: `"Failed to initialize embedding model: Error: Failed to initialize embedding model: Error: ...` (thousands of repetitions)
- System impact: Memory exhaustion leading to GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY and system crashes

**Fix Clues for Developers**:

1. **Immediate Circuit Breaker**: Add initialization attempt counter with max limit (3-5 attempts)
   ```typescript
   private static initAttempts = 0;
   private static readonly MAX_INIT_ATTEMPTS = 3;
   ```

2. **Environment Validation**: Check env availability before initialization
   ```typescript
   const env = (globalThis as any).env;
   if (!env || typeof env !== 'object') {
     throw new Error('Environment not properly initialized');
   }
   ```

3. **Singleton Pattern Enhancement**: Prevent concurrent initialization attempts
   ```typescript
   private static isInitializing = false;
   private static initPromise: Promise<void> | null = null;
   ```

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Disable embedding features when initialization fails
   ```typescript
   embeddingEnabled: false // Fallback mode
   ```

**Priority**: CRITICAL - System stability blocker affecting all tool evaluations

**Impact on Framework**: Cannot proceed with tool comparison until embedding initialization is stabilized. Risk of data loss during evaluation sessions.

## 17. Basic Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: System Stabilization (Week 1)
1. **Fix embedding crash** - Implement circuit breaker in `src/semantic/embedding-generator.ts`
2. **Test stability** - Create basic test for initialization scenarios
3. **Verify system** - Ensure MCP server starts without crashes

### Phase 2: Tool Comparison Setup (Week 2)
1. **Define test tasks** - Create 5 simple code discovery tasks
2. **Set up measurement** - Basic timing and accuracy tracking
3. **Prepare environments** - Native Claude vs MCP CodeGraph

### Phase 3: Evaluation (Week 3)
1. **Run comparison** - Execute tasks with both tools
2. **Collect data** - Time, accuracy, user satisfaction
3. **Analyze results** - Simple statistical comparison

## 18. Simple Evaluation Methodology

### Test Tasks (Keep Simple)
- **T1**: Find function definition by name
- **T2**: List all callers of a specific function
- **T3**: Search for code implementing specific functionality
- **T4**: Identify relationships between classes
- **T5**: Analyze code complexity patterns

### Metrics (Essential Only)
- **Time to result**: How long to get first useful result

2. **Data loss** - Save results frequently during evaluation
3. **Tool unavailability** - Have backup testing approach
4. **Participant issues** - Start with small pilot (3 users)

### Simple Mitigations
- Test system stability before each session
- Use simple, local data storage
- Have fallback manual comparison method
- Document everything as you go

## 20. Basic Success Metrics
