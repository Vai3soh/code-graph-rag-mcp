## Summary and Next Steps

### Overall Success Target Summary

#### Quantitative Success Targets
- **Performance**: 100+ files/second average, <1GB peak memory
- **Quality**: >90% parsing accuracy across all languages
- **Reliability**: <1% error rate, >99.9% uptime
- **User Experience**: >85% developer satisfaction
- **Timeline**: 10-week implementation schedule adherence

#### Success Validation Approach
- **Automated**: Real-time monitoring and validation
- **Manual**: Phase-by-phase stakeholder review
- **Continuous**: Ongoing success criteria refinement
- **Proactive**: Early warning systems for success risks

### Implementation Integration

#### Success Criteria Integration with Project
1. **Testing Integration**: All criteria validated through TASK-002C testing framework
2. **Timeline Integration**: Criteria aligned with TASK-002B implementation timeline
3. **Resource Integration**: Success targets matched to resource allocation
4. **Risk Integration**: Failure criteria aligned with TASK-002C risk mitigation

#### Next Steps for Success Management
1. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement automated success criteria monitoring
2. **Dashboard Creation**: Create real-time success criteria dashboard
3. **Team Training**: Train team on success criteria and validation procedures
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand and approve criteria
