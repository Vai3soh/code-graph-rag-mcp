# TASK-002B: Resource Allocation & Timeline Creation

**Delegation Specification for Dev-Agent**

## Context from Dora Research Synthesis (TASK-002A)

Based on Dora's comprehensive research synthesis, this task creates detailed project management deliverables for multi-language parser support expansion.

### Research Foundation Received
- ✅ Complete technical foundations document (47 pages)
- ✅ Implementation sequence: Python → C → C++
- ✅ Timeline estimates: Python (2-3 weeks), C (1-2 weeks), C++ (2-4 weeks)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks and validation criteria
- ✅ Risk assessment matrix with 15+ identified risks
- ✅ Architecture integration analysis

## Dev-Agent Implementation Requirements

**YOU (dev-agent) are responsible for creating ALL project management deliverables.**
**The Conductor has analyzed Dora's research but CANNOT implement documents.**

### Primary Deliverables

#### 1. Resource Allocation Matrix
Create comprehensive resource allocation document:

**File**: `/docs/resource-allocation-matrix.md`

**Required Content**:
- Agent assignments for each language implementation
- CPU/memory requirements per parsing phase
- Concurrent processing capabilities (target: 10+ simultaneous operations)
- Hardware optimization requirements (SIMD, multi-core)
- Bundle size optimization strategies
- Memory usage targets (<1GB peak for large repositories)

#### 2. Implementation Timeline Document
Create detailed timeline with dependencies:

**File**: `/docs/implementation-timeline.md`

**Required Timeline Structure**:
```
Phase 1: Python Parser Support (2-3 weeks)
├── Week 1: Tree-sitter Python grammar integration
├── Week 2: Incremental parsing implementation
├── Week 3: Performance optimization & testing

Phase 2: C Parser Support (1-2 weeks)
├── Week 1: C grammar integration & entity extraction
├── Week 2: Performance validation & bundle optimization

Phase 3: C++ Parser Support (2-4 weeks)
├── Week 1-2: C++ grammar integration (complex syntax)
├── Week 3: Template and namespace support
├── Week 4: Performance optimization & integration testing

Phase 4: Integration & Validation (1 week)
├── Cross-language relationship analysis
├── Performance benchmarking validation
├── Memory usage optimization
```

#### 3. Milestone Scheduling Document
Create milestone tracking system:

**File**: `/docs/milestone-schedule.md`

**Required Content**:
- Dependency mapping between language implementations
- Quality gates for each phase (performance thresholds)
- Rollback procedures for failed milestones
- Success criteria validation checkpoints
- TASK-XXX tracking integration

#### 4. Agent Assignment Strategy
Document specialized agent roles:

**File**: `/docs/agent-assignment-strategy.md`

**Required Assignments**:
- ParserAgent: Language-specific parsing optimization
- IndexerAgent: Graph storage scaling for multi-language
- SemanticAgent: Cross-language similarity detection
- QueryAgent: Multi-language query capabilities
- ResourceManager: Hardware utilization optimization

### Implementation Instructions

1. **Use Dora's Research as Foundation**
   - Reference technical complexity assessments
   - Incorporate performance benchmark requirements
   - Include risk mitigation strategies from research

2. **Create Actionable Timelines**
   - Specific week-by-week breakdown
   - Clear deliverables for each milestone
   - Dependencies clearly mapped
   - Quality gates defined

3. **Resource Optimization Focus**
   - Bundle size optimization (lazy loading, code splitting)
   - Memory efficiency strategies
   - CPU utilization optimization
   - Concurrent processing capabilities

4. **Integration Requirements**
   - TASK-002B tracking in all documents
   - Cross-references to Dora's research findings
   - Compatibility with existing TASK-XXX system
   - Update change_log.md with deliverable tracking

5. **Quality Assurance**
   - Performance benchmarks for each language
   - Memory usage validation criteria
   - Rollback procedures for each phase
   - Success criteria measurement methods

## Expected Outcomes

**Deliverable Files to Create**:
- `/docs/resource-allocation-matrix.md`
- `/docs/implementation-timeline.md`
- `/docs/milestone-schedule.md`
- `/docs/agent-assignment-strategy.md`
- Update `/change_log.md` with TASK-002B tracking

**Performance Targets to Document**:
- Parse throughput: 100+ files/second per language
- Memory usage: <1GB peak for large repositories
- Query response: <100ms simple, <1s complex analysis
- Bundle optimization: <50% size increase per language

**Integration Requirements**:
- Compatibility with existing multi-agent architecture
- Resource manager throttling strategies
- SQLite storage scaling considerations
- Vector search optimization for multi-language

## Validation Criteria

Each deliverable must:
- ✅ Reference specific findings from Dora's research
- ✅ Include measurable performance targets
- ✅ Define clear success criteria
- ✅ Provide rollback procedures
- ✅ Integrate with TASK-XXX tracking
- ✅ Address identified risks from research synthesis

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Dev-agent completes all deliverables
2. Conductor validates against research foundation
3. Continue with remaining TASK-002 coordination tasks
4. Synthesize into final project plan
