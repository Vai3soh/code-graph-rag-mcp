# Project Rebuild Summary - Multi-Agent LiteRAG Architecture

## Date: 2025-09-14
## Rebuild Method: Incremental Migration (Complexity 9/10)

## Overview
Successfully transformed the MCP Server Codegraph project from a monolithic single-process architecture to a multi-agent LiteRAG system optimized for commodity hardware (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM).

## Completed Phase 0 Tasks

### 1. Repository Structure Reorganization ✅
- Created `./tmp` folder for obsolete files
- Moved monolithic `src/index.ts` to `tmp/index.ts.old`
- Established new modular directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── agents/
  │   ├── base.ts         # Base agent implementation
  │   └── coordinator.ts   # Coordinator agent for orchestration
  ├── core/
  │   ├── knowledge-bus.ts    # Inter-agent communication
  │   └── resource-manager.ts # Resource optimization
  ├── types/
  │   └── agent.ts        # Agent type definitions
  └── index.ts            # MCP server entry point
  ```

### 2. Multi-Agent Foundation ✅
- **Base Agent Class**: Abstract base with resource monitoring, task processing, and metrics
- **Coordinator Agent**: Implements task routing, load balancing, and agent pool management
- **Agent Types**: Defined PARSER, INDEXER, QUERY, SEMANTIC, and COORDINATOR agents
- **Resource Management**: Memory and CPU monitoring with throttling capabilities

### 3. Knowledge Sharing Infrastructure ✅
- **Knowledge Bus**: Pub/sub system for inter-agent communication
- **Topic-based routing**: Supports wildcards and regex patterns
- **Message Queue**: Direct agent-to-agent messaging with history
- **TTL Support**: Automatic cleanup of expired knowledge entries

### 4. Resource Optimization ✅
- **Resource Manager**: Monitors CPU, memory, and I/O usage
- **Allocation System**: Request/release pattern for resource management
- **Throttling**: Automatic throttling at 80% resource usage
- **Garbage Collection**: Forced GC during memory pressure

### 5. Build Configuration ✅
- **TypeScript Optimization**: Incremental builds, source maps, strict typing
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking, minification for production
- **Memory-Efficient Builds**: Disabled splitting to reduce build memory usage
- **Node.js 18+ Target**: Optimized for modern Node.js runtime

## Key Architectural Changes

### From Monolithic to Multi-Agent
- **Before**: Single process downloading external binary for graph analysis
- **After**: Distributed agent system with specialized roles and coordination

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy initialization of coordinator agent
- Resource-aware task scheduling
- Caching through knowledge bus
- Incremental processing support

### MCP Protocol Enhancements
- New tools: `query` for natural language queries, `get_metrics` for system monitoring
- Improved error handling and result caching
- Support for incremental indexing

## Dependencies Updated
- Removed: `uuid` (using Node.js built-in crypto)
- Added: `zod`, `zod-to-json-schema` for schema validation
- Updated: Version bumped to 2.0.0 for major architecture change

## Build Output
- Successfully compiled TypeScript to ES modules
- Generated type definitions for TypeScript consumers
- Executable permissions set for CLI usage
- Source maps included for debugging

## Next Steps (Phase 1-4)

### Phase 1: Multi-Agent Indexing Pipeline
- Implement Parser Agent with Tree-sitter integration
- Create Indexer Agent with SQLite storage
- Add incremental parsing capabilities

### Phase 2: Query and Semantic Agents
- Develop Query Agent for graph traversal
- Integrate Semantic Agent with vector store
- Implement hybrid search capabilities

### Phase 3: Agent Coordination Optimization
- Advanced task decomposition
- Cross-agent result synthesis
- Predictive resource allocation

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- Docker containerization
- Monitoring and observability
- Complete documentation

## Performance Targets Established
- **Memory Usage**: <1GB peak for large repositories
- **CPU Usage**: <80% during normal operations
- **Concurrent Agents**: Up to 10 agents
- **Task Queue**: 100 tasks maximum
- **Cold Start**: <30 seconds target

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Scalability**: Can add specialized agents without modifying core
2. **Resilience**: Agent failures don't crash the system
3. **Performance**: Resource-aware scheduling prevents overload
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agent types

## Validation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Build outputs generated correctly
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Dependencies properly configured
- ✅ Executable permissions set

The project has been successfully migrated to the multi-agent LiteRAG architecture foundation, ready for the next phases of development as outlined in the action plan.
