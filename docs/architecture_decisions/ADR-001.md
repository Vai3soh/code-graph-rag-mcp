# ADR-001: Multi-Language Parser Support Implementation

## Status
PROPOSED (Date: 2025-09-15)

## Context

### Current State
- Existing multi-agent LiteRAG architecture with TypeScript/JavaScript parsing
- SQLite-based graph storage with sqlite-vec vector search capability
- Tree-sitter incremental parsing for performance optimization
- 13 comprehensive MCP tools for code analysis
- Achieved targets: 100+ files/second parse throughput, <1GB memory usage
- Phase 1 Python integration completed successfully (180+ files/second, <150MB memory)

### Business Drivers
- User demand for Python, C, and C++ codebase analysis
- Competitive positioning in multi-language code intelligence
- Architecture scalability validation for future language additions
- Performance optimization requirements for large polyglot repositories
- Market expansion opportunity for systems programming language support

### Technical Constraints
- Commodity hardware targeting (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM)
- Bundle size optimization requirements (<100MB total increase)
- Backward compatibility with existing MCP tools
- Multi-agent resource coordination complexity
- Performance maintenance requirements (<10% regression)

## Decision

### Architecture Decision
Implement multi-language parser support through **incremental Tree-sitter integration** with **specialized parser agents** and **lazy-loading optimization**.

### Implementation Approach
**Sequential Language Integration**: Python → C → C++ based on complexity analysis and risk mitigation.

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Language-Specific Parser Agents
- **PythonParserAgent** ✅ COMPLETED: Advanced Python syntax support (async/await, decorators, import mapping)
- **CParserAgent**: Preprocessor and macro handling with conditional compilation support
- **CppParserAgent**: Template and namespace analysis with modern C++ feature support
- **Coordination**: Through existing ResourceManager and KnowledgeBus with inter-agent communication protocols

#### 2. Bundle Optimization Strategy
- **Lazy Loading**: Language parsers loaded on-demand to minimize initial bundle size
- **Code Splitting**: Separate bundles per language with dynamic imports
- **Grammar Caching**: Tree-sitter grammar caching for frequently used languages
- **Target Achievement**: <50MB bundle increase per language (Python achieved <30MB)

#### 3. Storage Architecture Extension
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible language metadata with migration support
- **Index Optimization**: Language-specific graph indexing with cross-language relationship mapping
- **Cross-Language Relations**: Unified relationship modeling for include/import dependencies
- **Vector Store**: Language-agnostic semantic embeddings with sqlite-vec acceleration

#### 4. Performance Architecture
- **Incremental Processing**: Per-language parser optimization with concurrent agent execution
- **Resource Throttling**: Memory and CPU usage controls with graceful degradation
- **Concurrent Processing**: 10+ simultaneous parsing operations across languages
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics per language with automated alerting

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

#### Technical Rationale (from Dora's comprehensive analysis)
1. **Tree-sitter Ecosystem Maturity**: Proven parsers for target languages with active maintenance
   - Python: v0.25.0 with comprehensive syntax support ✅ validated
   - C: v0.25.0 with preprocessor directive handling
   - C++: v0.23.2 with template and modern feature support
2. **Incremental Architecture**: Leverages existing multi-agent foundation without major refactoring
3. **Performance Scalability**: Linear scaling with language additions proven by Python implementation
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Sequential rollout minimizes integration complexity and enables rollback procedures

#### Business Rationale
1. **Time-to-Market**: 10-week implementation timeline with Python already delivering value
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Utilizes existing architecture investments and development expertise
3. **User Experience**: No breaking changes to existing functionality, transparent multi-language support
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Multi-language analysis capability with performance leadership

### Implementation Sequence Justification

#### Python First (Weeks 1-3) ✅ COMPLETED
- **Rationale**: Highest user demand, moderate complexity for architecture validation
- **Achievement**: 180+ files/second (exceeded 150+ target), <150MB memory (exceeded <200MB target)
- **Benefits**: Validated architecture extensibility, immediate user value, performance baseline
- **Risks Mitigated**: Grammar complexity manageable, strong community support, successful integration

#### C Second (Weeks 4-5)
- **Rationale**: Lower complexity than C++, validates systems programming support
- **Benefits**: Foundation for C++ implementation, performance validation for compiled languages
- **Target**: 100+ files/second, <150MB additional memory
- **Risks**: Preprocessor complexity manageable with Tree-sitter v0.25.0 support

#### C++ Last (Weeks 6-9)
- **Rationale**: Highest complexity, requires architecture stability from previous phases
- **Benefits**: Complete systems programming language support, template analysis capability
- **Target**: 75+ files/second, <250MB additional memory
- **Risks**: Template complexity mitigated by mature Tree-sitter grammar and phased approach

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration
**Rejected Reason**: External dependency complexity, performance overhead, resource constraints
**Detailed Analysis**:
- Performance Impact: Estimated 3-5x slower than Tree-sitter direct integration
- Resource Overhead: LSP server management, process coordination, IPC communication
- Complexity: Multi-language LSP server lifecycle management
- Reliability: External process failures, version compatibility issues

### Alternative 2: Custom Parser Development
**Rejected Reason**: Development complexity, maintenance burden, timeline constraints
**Detailed Analysis**:
- Development Timeline: 6-12 month development timeline per language
- Maintenance Overhead: Grammar evolution tracking, syntax updates, community support
- Resource Requirements: 3-5x development resources compared to Tree-sitter integration
- Risk Assessment: High technical debt, limited community contribution potential

### Alternative 3: Simultaneous Multi-Language Implementation
**Rejected Reason**: Integration complexity, resource allocation challenges, risk amplification
**Detailed Analysis**:
- Integration Risk: Higher risk of architecture conflicts, difficult rollback procedures
- Resource Impact: Would require 3x development resources for parallel implementation
- Testing Complexity: Exponential testing matrix for multi-language interactions
- Quality Risk: Reduced focus per language, potential for system-wide regression

### Alternative 4: External Service Integration
**Rejected Reason**: Latency, dependency, data privacy concerns, cost implications
**Detailed Analysis**:
- Performance Impact: Network latency would violate <100ms query response targets
- Privacy Concerns: Code analysis data would require external transmission
- Dependency Risk: Service availability, rate limiting, vendor lock-in
- Cost Structure: Per-request pricing model unsuitable for high-volume analysis

### Alternative 5: Rust-based Parser Implementation
**Rejected Reason**: Language ecosystem change, development overhead, integration complexity
**Detailed Analysis**:
- Ecosystem Shift: Would require Rust development expertise and toolchain changes
- Performance Gains: Marginal performance improvements offset by development complexity
- Integration Effort: FFI integration complexity with existing TypeScript/Node.js stack
- Timeline Impact: 2-3x development timeline due to ecosystem differences
