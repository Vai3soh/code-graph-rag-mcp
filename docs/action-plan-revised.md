Focus: Commodity hardware optimization with multi-agent patterns

This revised plan integrates LiteRAG (Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architectural patterns and optimizes for commodity hardware performance. It builds upon the original action plan while incorporating specialized documentation for each external library and integration pattern.

## Architecture Overview

The revised architecture embraces a multi-agent approach optimized for commodity hardware (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM, SSD storage):
