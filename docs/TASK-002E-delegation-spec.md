**File**: `/docs/architecture_decisions/ADR-001.md`

**Required ADR Structure Based on Dora's Research**:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Multi-Language Parser Support Implementation

## Status
PROPOSED (Date: [Current Date])

## Context

### Current State
- Existing multi-agent LiteRAG architecture with TypeScript/JavaScript parsing
- SQLite-based graph storage with sqlite-vec vector search capability
- Tree-sitter incremental parsing for performance optimization
- 13 comprehensive MCP tools for code analysis
- Target: 100+ files/second parse throughput, <1GB memory usage

### Business Drivers
- User demand for Python, C, and C++ codebase analysis
- Competitive positioning in multi-language code intelligence
- Architecture scalability validation for future language additions
- Performance optimization requirements for large polyglot repositories

### Technical Constraints
- Commodity hardware targeting (4-core CPU, 8GB RAM)
- Bundle size optimization requirements
- Backward compatibility with existing MCP tools
- Multi-agent resource coordination complexity

## Decision

### Architecture Decision
Implement multi-language parser support through **incremental Tree-sitter integration** with **specialized parser agents** and **lazy-loading optimization**.

### Implementation Approach
**Sequential Language Integration**: Python → C → C++ based on complexity analysis

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Language-Specific Parser Agents
- **PythonParserAgent**: Advanced Python syntax support (async/await, decorators)
- **CParserAgent**: Preprocessor and macro handling
- **CppParserAgent**: Template and namespace analysis
- **Coordination**: Through existing ResourceManager and KnowledgeBus

#### 2. Bundle Optimization Strategy
- **Lazy Loading**: Language parsers loaded on-demand
- **Code Splitting**: Separate bundles per language
- **Caching**: Grammar caching for frequently used languages
- **Target**: <50MB bundle increase per language

#### 3. Storage Architecture Extension
- **Schema Evolution**: Backward-compatible language metadata
- **Index Optimization**: Language-specific graph indexing
- **Cross-Language Relations**: Unified relationship modeling
- **Vector Store**: Language-agnostic semantic embeddings

#### 4. Performance Architecture
- **Incremental Processing**: Per-language parser optimization
- **Resource Throttling**: Memory and CPU usage controls
- **Concurrent Processing**: 10+ simultaneous parsing operations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics per language

## Rationale

### Why This Approach

#### Technical Rationale (from Dora's analysis)
1. **Tree-sitter Ecosystem Maturity**: Proven parsers for target languages
2. **Incremental Architecture**: Leverages existing multi-agent foundation
3. **Performance Scalability**: Linear scaling with language additions
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Sequential rollout minimizes integration complexity

#### Business Rationale
1. **Time-to-Market**: 10-week implementation timeline
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Utilizes existing architecture investments
3. **User Experience**: No breaking changes to existing functionality
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Multi-language analysis capability

### Implementation Sequence Justification

#### Python First (Weeks 1-3)
- **Rationale**: Highest user demand, moderate complexity
- **Benefits**: Validates architecture, provides immediate value
- **Risks**: Manageable grammar complexity, strong community support

#### C Second (Weeks 4-5)
- **Rationale**: Lower complexity than C++, validates systems programming support
- **Benefits**: Foundation for C++ implementation, performance validation
- **Risks**: Preprocessor complexity manageable with Tree-sitter support

#### C++ Last (Weeks 6-9)
- **Rationale**: Highest complexity, requires architecture stability
- **Benefits**: Complete systems programming language support
- **Risks**: Template complexity mitigated by mature Tree-sitter grammar

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration
**Rejected Reason**: External dependency complexity, performance overhead
**Analysis**: Would require LSP server management, network communication overhead
**Performance Impact**: Estimated 3-5x slower than Tree-sitter direct integration

### Alternative 2: Custom Parser Development
**Rejected Reason**: Development complexity, maintenance burden
**Analysis**: 6-12 month development timeline per language
**Risk Assessment**: High maintenance overhead, grammar evolution tracking

### Alternative 3: Simultaneous Multi-Language Implementation
**Rejected Reason**: Integration complexity, resource allocation challenges
**Analysis**: Higher risk of architecture conflicts, difficult rollback procedures
**Resource Impact**: Would require 3x development resources for parallel implementation

### Alternative 4: External Service Integration
**Rejected Reason**: Latency, dependency, and data privacy concerns
**Analysis**: Network latency would violate <100ms query response targets
**Privacy Impact**: Code analysis data would require external transmission

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

#### Technical Benefits
- **Performance Scalability**: Linear performance scaling with language additions
- **Architecture Validation**: Proves multi-agent architecture extensibility
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal hardware utilization on commodity systems
- **Integration Simplicity**: Leverages existing Tree-sitter and SQLite infrastructure

#### Business Benefits
- **Market Expansion**: Serves Python, C, and C++ developer communities
- **Competitive Positioning**: Multi-language code intelligence capability
- **Revenue Growth**: Expanded addressable market for code analysis tools
- **Platform Validation**: Architecture suitable for future language additions

### Negative Consequences

#### Technical Challenges
- **Bundle Size Growth**: 50-100MB additional bundle size
- **Memory Usage Increase**: 300-700MB additional peak memory usage
- **Complexity Increase**: Multi-language coordination complexity

#### Business Challenges
- **Development Resource Allocation**: 10-week focused development effort
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Multi-language grammar updates and compatibility
- **Support Complexity**: User support across multiple programming languages
- **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive multi-language documentation

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Technical Risk Mitigation
1. **Sequential Implementation**: Reduces integration complexity
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics prevent performance regression
3. **Rollback Procedures**: Language-specific rollback capability
4. **Lazy Loading**: Minimizes resource usage for unused languages

#### Business Risk Mitigation
1. **Incremental Delivery**: Value delivery at each language milestone
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Early feedback incorporation during development
3. **Compatibility Preservation**: Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
4. **Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive documentation for each language
