# Agent Usage Guide

## Overview

This guide provides practical instructions for using the multi-agent system in the Code Graph RAG MCP project, including when to use which agent, how to structure requests, and best practices for effective collaboration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Complex Development Tasks
```bash
# ALWAYS start with Conductor for any complex work
use agent conductor
  implement new vector search optimization for large codebases
```

### For Research Tasks  
```bash
# Use Dora for comprehensive research
use agent dora
  research best practices for semantic search in code analysis
```

### For Simple Questions
```bash
# Direct questions can be asked without agents
# But complex analysis should use agents
```

## üéØ When to Use Each Agent

### üü° Conductor Agent
**Use For**: All complex tasks requiring coordination

#### ‚úÖ **ALWAYS Use Conductor For:**
- Multi-step development tasks (>2 steps)
- Architecture changes or refactoring
- Performance optimization projects
- Bug fixes affecting multiple files
- Feature implementation with dependencies
- Integration of new technologies
- Database schema changes
- API modifications affecting multiple endpoints

#### üìù **Request Structure:**
```bash
use agent conductor
  [clear task description with context]
  
# Examples:
use agent conductor
  optimize the vector search performance for large codebases
  
use agent conductor
  implement comprehensive error handling across the MCP tools
  
use agent conductor
  refactor the multi-agent coordination system for better reliability
```

#### üîÑ **What Conductor Does:**
1. **Analyze** task complexity (1-10 scale)
2. **Generate** 5 distinct method proposals
3. **Require approval** if complexity >5
4. **Delegate** to appropriate specialized agents
5. **Track** progress with TASK-XXX identifiers
6. **Validate** completion and quality

### üîµ Dev Agent  
**Use For**: NO DIRECT USE - Conductor manages this agent

#### ‚ùå **Cannot Use Directly:**
- dev-agent only accepts tasks from Conductor
- Direct requests will be rejected
- All implementation work must go through Conductor

#### ‚úÖ **What dev-agent Does (via Conductor):**
- Code implementation and file modifications
- Testing and validation
- Documentation generation
- GRACE-compliant development with semantic scaffolding
- Observable Belief State logging

use agent dora
  [specific research question or analysis request]
  
# Examples:
use agent dora
  research current trends in vector database optimization
  
use agent dora
  analyze competitor approaches to code graph analysis
  
use agent dora
  investigate best practices for MCP server performance
```

#### üîÑ **What Dora Does:**
1. **Comprehensive research** across multiple sources
2. **Data triangulation** and validation
3. **Strategic analysis** with actionable insights
4. **Documentation creation** in Memory Bank
5. **Knowledge synthesis** and pattern identification

### üü† MCP Agent Gemini
**Use For**: NO DIRECT USE - Conductor coordinates this agent

#### ‚ùå **Cannot Use Directly:**
- mcp-agent-gemini only accepts tasks from Conductor
- Specialized for Gemini MCP service coordination

# Step 2: Review 5 method proposals
# Conductor will present 5 different approaches

# Step 3: Approve preferred method
# "Approved, proceed with Solution #3"

# Step 4: Monitor progress
# Check .memory_bank/current_tasks.md for status

# Step 5: Validate completion
# Conductor ensures quality and completeness
```

### Research Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Define research scope
use agent dora
  analyze vector database performance optimization techniques

# Step 2: Review findings
# Dora provides comprehensive analysis with sources

# Step 3: Apply insights
# Use research findings for informed decision-making

# Step 4: Update knowledge
# Dora integrates findings into Memory Bank
```

### Troubleshooting Workflow
```bash
# Step 1: Use Conductor for systematic approach
use agent conductor
  debug and fix the vector embedding generation failures

# Step 2: Let Conductor coordinate diagnosis
# May deploy Research Trinity for complex issues

# Step 3: Follow systematic resolution
# Conductor ensures proper root cause analysis

# Step 4: Validate fix and prevent recurrence

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### For Effective Agent Usage

#### 1. **Be Specific and Clear**
```bash
# ‚ùå Vague request
use agent conductor
  make the system faster

# ‚úÖ Specific request  
use agent conductor
  optimize vector search query response time from 150ms to <50ms for codebases with 10k+ files
```

#### 2. **Provide Context**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good context
use agent conductor
  implement error retry logic for the MCP tools because users report 
  timeout failures when analyzing large codebases like chromium
```

#### 3. **Follow Task Progression**

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå **Don't Do This:**

#### 1. **Skip Conductor for Complex Tasks**
```bash
# ‚ùå Wrong - trying to use dev-agent directly
use agent dev-agent
  implement new caching system

# ‚úÖ Correct - use Conductor
use agent conductor
  implement new caching system
```

#### 2. **Vague Task Descriptions**
```bash
# ‚ùå Too vague
use agent conductor
  fix the bugs

# ‚úÖ Specific and actionable
use agent conductor
  fix the memory leak in vector embedding generation causing 
  OOM errors after processing 1000+ files
```

#### 3. **Ignore Complexity Assessment**
```bash
# ‚ùå Dismissing approval workflow
# When Conductor says "complexity 8/10, approval required"
# Don't skip the review process
```

#### 4. **Mix Concerns in Single Request**
```bash
# ‚ùå Multiple unrelated tasks
use agent conductor
  implement caching AND fix the UI bugs AND update documentation

# ‚úÖ Separate requests for different concerns
use agent conductor
  implement caching layer for vector operations
```

## üìä Monitoring and Progress Tracking

### Real-Time Status
```bash
# Check current active tasks
cat .memory_bank/current_tasks.md

# Review specific task log
cat .memory_bank/logs_llm/TASK-XXX.log

# Check recent changes
