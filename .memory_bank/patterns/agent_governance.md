# Agent Governance & Management

## Overview

This document defines the governance framework for the multi-agent system used in the Code Graph RAG MCP project, ensuring systematic coordination, quality control, and architectural integrity across all development activities.

## üéØ Governance Principles

### GRACE Framework Compliance
All agents operate under the **GRACE Framework** (Graph-RAG Anchored Code Engineering):

1. **Intent-First Architecture**: Machine-readable requirements analysis before implementation
2. **Synthesis from Approved Blueprints**: Deterministic code generation from architectural frameworks
3. **AI-Readable Scaffolding**: Semantic markup with XML-like anchors
4. **Context via Knowledge Graph**: .memory_bank integration for full traceability
5. **Observable AI Belief State**: Transparent decision-making through structured logging
6. **End-to-End Traceability**: Complete linkage from requirements to implementation
7. **Governed Autonomy**: Human oversight with AI freedom within approved frameworks

### Core Governance Rules

#### 1. Mandatory Conductor Usage
**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: All complex tasks MUST use the Conductor agent.

**Complexity Triggers (Any of the following):**
- Multi-step tasks (>2 steps)
- Cross-file modifications
- Architecture changes
- Performance optimization
- Bug fixes requiring investigation
- Feature integration
- Dependency changes

**Enforcement**: Direct agent access for complex tasks will be rejected.

#### 2. Agent Access Control
| Agent | Access Level | Restrictions |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **conductor** | Direct User Access | Orchestration only - NO implementation |
| **dev-agent** | Conductor Only | Cannot accept direct user requests |
| **dora** | Direct + Conductor | Prefers Conductor coordination |
| **mcp-agent-gemini** | Conductor Only | Specialized for Gemini MCP services |

#### 3. Task Validation Requirements
All agent tasks must include:
- ‚úÖ **TASK-XXX Identifier**: Unique tracking number
- ‚úÖ **Chosen Method**: From Conductor's 5 proposals (for implementation tasks)
- ‚úÖ **Memory Bank Context**: Relevant .memory_bank references
- ‚úÖ **ADR Reference**: Architecture Decision Record (if applicable)

## üîÑ Agent Coordination Patterns

### Standard Workflow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Conductor Agent]
    B --> C[Complexity Assessment 1-10]
    C --> D{Complexity > 5?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Generate 5 Method Proposals]
    D -->|No| F[Direct Method Selection]
    E --> G[User Approval Required]
    F --> H[Task Delegation]
    G --> H
    H --> I{Task Type?}
    I -->|Code| J[dev-agent]
    I -->|Research| K[dora]
    I -->|Gemini Integration| L[mcp-agent-gemini]
    J --> M[Implementation + Logging]
    K --> N[Research + Documentation]
    L --> O[MCP Service Coordination]
    M --> P[Validation & Completion]
    N --> P
    O --> P
    P --> Q[Memory Bank Updates]
```

### Research Trinity Pattern (Circular Bug Resolution)
**Trigger**: Repeated failures or circular issues detected

1. **Implementation Halt**: Stop all fix attempts immediately
2. **Research Trinity Deployment**:
   - **dora**: Documentation, best practices, historical solutions
   - **mcp-agent-gemini**: Alternative approaches, creative solutions  
   - **Additional agents**: Specialized analysis as needed
3. **Root Cause Investigation**: Focus on underlying causes, not symptoms
4. **Solution Redesign**: Create comprehensive new approach
5. **Validated Implementation**: Execute through dev-agent with safeguards

### Parallel Research Pattern
**Use Case**: Complex research requiring multiple perspectives

1. **Primary Research**: dora leads comprehensive investigation
2. **Parallel Research**: mcp-agent-gemini provides alternative analysis
3. **Synthesis**: Conductor consolidates findings from both agents
4. **Validation**: Cross-reference findings for consistency
5. **Documentation**: Integrated results in Memory Bank

## üìã Task Management Framework

### TASK-XXX Lifecycle
```
TASK-001: [Created] ‚Üí [Assigned] ‚Üí [In Progress] ‚Üí [Validation] ‚Üí [Completed] ‚Üí [Archived]
```

#### Task States
- **TODO**: Identified but not yet started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on by assigned agent
- **VALIDATION**: Under review and testing
- **DONE**: Completed and validated
- **ARCHIVED**: Moved to historical records

#### Task Tracking Locations
- **Active**: `.memory_bank/current_tasks.md`
- **Historical**: `.memory_bank/tasks_YYMMDD.md` (archived by date)
- **Detailed Logs**: `.memory_bank/logs_llm/TASK-XXX.log`

### Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
**Format**: ADR-XXX linked to TASK-XXX identifiers

#### ADR Triggers
- Architecture changes (complexity >5)
- Technology selection decisions
- Performance optimization strategies
- Integration pattern decisions
- Security implementation choices

#### ADR Template
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

**Related**: TASK-XXX
**Status**: [Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[Background and driving forces]

## Decision
[Chosen solution and reasoning]

## Consequences
[Positive and negative outcomes]

## Implementation
[GRACE compliance markers and semantic scaffolding]
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Quality Assurance Framework

### Code Quality Gates
All implementation tasks must pass:

1. **Architectural Compliance**: Follows approved blueprints and ADR decisions
2. **GRACE Standards**: Includes semantic scaffolding and Observable Belief State
3. **Memory Bank Integration**: Updates relevant patterns and documentation
4. **Testing Validation**: Passes all relevant tests
5. **Performance Benchmarks**: Meets established performance targets

### Review Process
1. **Self-Review**: Agent validates against GRACE principles
2. **Automated Validation**: Linting, type checking, and basic tests
3. **Architectural Review**: Conductor validates against approved method
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end functionality validation
5. **Documentation Review**: Memory Bank consistency and completeness

### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Failure Detection**: Automated monitoring of task execution
- **Rollback Procedures**: All actions include rollback commands
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error documentation in task logs
- **Recovery Protocols**: Systematic approach to failure resolution

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics
