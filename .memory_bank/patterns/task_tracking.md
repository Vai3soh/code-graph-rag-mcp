# Task Tracking Patterns

## Overview

This document defines the task tracking methodology for xldb_proxy development, including TASK-XXX identifiers, status management, and lifecycle tracking across the three-agent architecture.

## Task Identification System

### TASK-XXX Format
```
FORMAT: TASK-[NNN]
EXAMPLE: TASK-001, TASK-042, TASK-123
SEQUENCE: Sequential numbering starting from 001
SCOPE: Project-wide unique identifiers
```

### Task Categories
- **IMPL**: Implementation tasks (new features, bug fixes)
- **ARCH**: Architecture decisions and design
- **TEST**: Testing and validation
- **DOCS**: Documentation updates
- **REFACTOR**: Code refactoring and optimization
- **DEPLOY**: Deployment and configuration

### Category Integration
```
FULL FORMAT: TASK-[NNN]-[CATEGORY]
EXAMPLES:
- TASK-001-IMPL: Implement PostgreSQL SSL connection
- TASK-002-ARCH: Design NoSQL adapter pattern
- TASK-003-TEST: Add integration tests for ClickHouse
```

## Status Lifecycle

### Status States
```
PENDING â†’ IN_PROGRESS â†’ [BLOCKED] â†’ COMPLETED
                      â†“
                   CANCELLED
```

### Status Definitions
- **PENDING**: Task identified, not yet started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies
- **COMPLETED**: Successfully finished
- **CANCELLED**: Task no longer needed

### Status Tracking Location
Primary: `.memory_bank/current_tasks.md`
Secondary: Individual agent reports

## Current Tasks Management

### Kanban Board Structure
```markdown
## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **TASK-001-IMPL** (dev-sqlengines): Implement MongoDB NoSQL adapter
  - Status: IN_PROGRESS
  - Agent: dev-sqlengines
  - Started: 2024-01-15
  - Estimated: 2 days

## ðŸ“‹ Pending
- **TASK-002-ARCH** (Conductor): Design graph database pattern
  - Priority: Medium
  - Dependencies: TASK-001-IMPL
  - Agent: TBD

## âœ… Completed
- **TASK-000-ARCH** (Conductor): Establish Memory Bank structure
  - Completed: 2024-01-14
  - Agent: Conductor
  - Result: Full Memory Bank implementation
```

### Task Entry Template
```markdown
- **TASK-XXX-CATEGORY** (Agent): [Brief Description]
  - Status: [PENDING|IN_PROGRESS|BLOCKED|COMPLETED]
  - Agent: [Conductor|dev-agent|dev-sqlengines]
  - Started: [YYYY-MM-DD]
  - Estimated: [X days/hours]
  - Dependencies: [TASK-XXX references]
  - Files: [List of affected files]
  - Notes: [Additional context]
```

## Agent-Specific Tracking

### Conductor Tasks
**Scope**: Project orchestration, architecture decisions
**Tracking Focus**:
- Task delegation efficiency
- Architecture decision points
- Cross-agent coordination
- Memory Bank maintenance

**Example**:
```markdown
TASK-015-ARCH (Conductor): Design database connection pooling strategy
- Analysis of current connection patterns
- Evaluation of pooling libraries
- Architecture decision documentation
- Implementation task delegation
```

### Dev-Agent Tasks
**Scope**: General application development
**Tracking Focus**:
- API development progress
- Model implementation
- Integration testing
- Documentation updates

**Example**:
```markdown
TASK-023-IMPL (dev-agent): Implement file upload API endpoint
- FastAPI router implementation
- Request/response models
- Validation logic
- Integration with file service
```

### Dev-SQLEngines Tasks
**Scope**: Database connectivity and SQL engines
**Tracking Focus**:
- Engine implementation progress
- Driver integration
- Database-specific optimizations
- Connection testing

**Example**:
```markdown
TASK-018-IMPL (dev-sqlengines): Add Snowflake connectivity
- Driver installation and configuration
- Engine class implementation
- Authentication method support
- Query optimization
```

## Dependency Management

### Dependency Types
1. **Sequential**: TASK-B cannot start until TASK-A completes
2. **Parallel**: TASK-C and TASK-D can run simultaneously
3. **Resource**: Tasks requiring same agent/resource
4. **Technical**: Implementation dependencies

### Dependency Notation
```markdown
Dependencies:
- BLOCKS: TASK-025 (waiting for database schema)
- BLOCKED_BY: TASK-019 (needs API endpoint first)
- RELATED: TASK-030 (similar implementation pattern)
```

### Dependency Resolution
```
1. Identify blocking tasks
2. Prioritize dependency resolution
3. Update dependent task estimates
4. Communicate changes to affected agents
```

## Progress Reporting

### Daily Updates
Each agent updates current tasks with:
- Progress percentage
- Completion estimates
- Blockers encountered
- Next steps planned

### Weekly Reviews
Conductor reviews:
- Completed tasks summary
- In-progress task status
- Upcoming task priorities
- Resource allocation

### Monthly Analysis
- Task completion velocity
- Pattern identification
- Process improvements
- Capacity planning

## Time Tracking

### Estimation Guidelines
```
SIMPLE (0.5-1 day):
- Minor bug fixes
- Configuration updates
- Documentation additions

MEDIUM (1-3 days):
- New API endpoints
- Database engine implementations
- Feature enhancements

COMPLEX (3-7 days):
- Major architectural changes
- Multi-component integrations
- Performance optimizations

EPIC (1-2 weeks):
- Complete subsystem implementations
- Major refactoring projects
- New integration patterns
```

### Actual vs. Estimated Tracking
```markdown
TASK-XXX Completion Report:
- Estimated: 2 days
- Actual: 2.5 days
- Variance: +25%
- Reason: Additional SSL configuration complexity
- Learning: Update future SSL task estimates
```

## Quality Gates

### Task Completion Criteria
1. **Implementation Complete**: All code changes made
2. **Testing Passed**: Unit and integration tests passing
3. **Documentation Updated**: Relevant docs updated
4. **Code Review**: Peer review completed
5. **Memory Bank Updated**: New knowledge captured

### Definition of Done

- Implementation patterns
- Common pitfalls
- Time estimation improvements
- Agent skill development

### Process Improvement
Regular analysis of:
- Task completion velocity
- Estimation accuracy
- Blocker frequency
- Agent utilization

## Operational Logging Integration

### Logging Structure
Task execution details stored in `.memory_bank/logs_llm/`:

#### Structured Logs
- **TASK-XXX.json**: Complete execution trace with rollback commands
- **TASK-XXX.log**: Human-readable progress updates and status
- **[filename]_llm.log**: File-specific modification logs

#### Log Contents
```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK-XXX",
  "status": "completed|failed|in_progress",
  "execution_log": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "description",
      "timestamp": "ISO 8601",
      "rollback_command": "undo command"
    }
  ],
  "memory_bank_references": ["patterns/", "guides/", "workflows/"]
}
```

#### Integration with Task Tracking
- Strategic planning in `.memory_bank/current_tasks.md`
- Operational execution in `.memory_bank/logs_llm/TASK-XXX.*`
- Knowledge synthesis in `.memory_bank/patterns/` and `.memory_bank/guides/`

### Complementary Systems
- **Memory Bank**: Strategic knowledge management (WHAT and WHY)
- **Operational Logs**: Execution details (HOW and WHEN)
- **Task Tracking**: Status coordination (WHERE in lifecycle)
