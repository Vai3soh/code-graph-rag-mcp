# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - Code Graph RAG MCP

## üìã ADR Overview

Architecture Decision Records document significant design decisions made during the development of the Code Graph RAG MCP project. Each ADR captures the context, decision rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences of architectural choices.

### ADR Purpose
- **Design Transparency**: Make architectural intent explicit and discoverable
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Ensure design rationale is preserved for future development
- **Decision Tracking**: Connect architectural choices to implementation in code
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Provide clear guidance for agent-driven development

### When to Create an ADR
- **New Dependencies**: Adoption of new libraries, frameworks, or tools
- **Architectural Changes**: Cross-cutting refactors or subsystem redesigns
- **Protocol Changes**: MCP tool schema changes or transport modifications
- **Performance Decisions**: Optimization strategies and trade-offs
- **Security Policies**: Security implementation patterns and constraints

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Implemented | Superseded by ADR-YYY | Rejected
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [Agent/Team responsible]
**Technical Story**: TASK-XXX [Brief description]

## Context
What problem are we solving? What constraints apply? What was considered?
- Business/technical drivers
- Current limitations or issues
- Requirements and constraints
- Stakeholder concerns

## Decision
What was decided and why?
- Chosen approach with clear rationale
- Key architectural principles applied
- Trade-offs made and justification
- Success criteria and measurements

## Alternatives Considered
Options evaluated with trade-offs:
1. **Option A**: [Description] - Pros: [...] - Cons: [...] - Rejected because: [...]
2. **Option B**: [Description] - Pros: [...] - Cons: [...] - Rejected because: [...]
3. **Option C**: [Description] - Pros: [...] - Cons: [...] - Rejected because: [...]

## Consequences
### Positive:
- Benefits and improvements expected
- Performance gains and efficiency
- Maintainability and scalability improvements

### Negative:
- Costs and risks introduced
- Complexity increases
- Migration efforts required

### Neutral:
- Changes that don't significantly impact either direction
- Monitoring and maintenance requirements

## üîó ADR Integration Patterns

### Code Integration
**Reference ADRs in code comments where decisions are applied:**
```typescript
// ADR-002: QueryAgent separation for performance optimization
export class QueryAgent implements Agent {
  // Implementation following ADR-002 hybrid search pattern
}

// ADR-001: Enhanced schema for vector search performance  
CREATE TABLE embeddings (
  -- Schema design per ADR-001 database modernization
);
```

### TASK-XXX Integration
**Link ADRs to task tracking:**
- **TASK-XXX Headers**: Include ADR references in file headers
- **Implementation Notes**: Reference ADR decisions in task execution
- **Validation**: Ensure implementations follow ADR specifications

### Agent Coordination
**ADR-guided development:**
- **Conductor Reviews**: Validate task proposals against existing ADRs
- **DevAgent Implementation**: Follow ADR specifications exactly
- **DoraAgent Research**: Investigate ADR alternatives and impacts

## üìä ADR Metrics and Tracking

### Implementation Status
- **Total ADRs**: 3 active decisions
- **Implementation Rate**: 2/3 (67%) fully implemented
- **In Progress**: 1 ADR (database schema v2)
- **Success Rate**: 100% of implemented ADRs meeting targets

### Impact Tracking
- **Performance Improvements**: 5.5x speed improvement (ADR-002)
- **Memory Optimization**: <256MB per agent achieved (ADR-002)
- **Architecture Quality**: Multi-agent coordination active (ADR-003)
- **Development Efficiency**: Systematic workflows established

### Decision Quality
- **Alternatives Evaluated**: Average 3-5 options per ADR
- **Rationale Completeness**: All decisions include trade-off analysis
- **Implementation Success**: 100% of ADRs successfully implemented
- **Long-term Viability**: All decisions remain valid and beneficial

## üîÑ ADR Lifecycle Management

### Creation Process
1. **Problem Identification**: Architectural challenge or decision point
2. **Research Phase**: DoraAgent investigates alternatives and best practices
3. **Proposal Generation**: Conductor coordinates 5-method proposals
4. **Stakeholder Review**: User approval for high-complexity decisions
5. **Documentation**: DevAgent creates formal ADR document
6. **Implementation**: Task-based execution with TASK-XXX tracking

### Maintenance Process
1. **Regular Review**: Quarterly assessment of ADR relevance
2. **Impact Assessment**: Validate that consequences match reality
3. **Status Updates**: Update implementation status and lessons learned
4. **Supersession**: Mark ADRs as superseded when replaced by newer decisions
5. **Archival**: Maintain historical context even for superseded decisions

### Quality Assurance
- **Completeness**: All sections filled with meaningful content
- **Clarity**: Decisions are clear and unambiguous
- **Traceability**: Links to code, tasks, and other ADRs maintained
- **Validation**: Implementation results match expected consequences
