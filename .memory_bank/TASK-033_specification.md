TASK-033: Quality Audit of 8 SQL Engine Implementations

## Task Description

Perform a comprehensive quality audit and analysis of 8 SQL engine implementations that were created without proper dev-agent involvement and workflow compliance.

## Engines to Audit

1. **Tarantool** (sqlengines/tarantool.py) - TASK-025
2. **YDB** (sqlengines/ydb.py) - TASK-026 
3. **YTsaurus** (sqlengines/ytsaurus.py) - TASK-027
4. **ODBC** (sqlengines/odbc.py) - TASK-028
5. **DBF** (sqlengines/dbf.py) - TASK-029
6. **DolphinDB** (sqlengines/dolphindb.py) - TASK-030
7. **Apache Iceberg** (sqlengines/apache_iceberg.py) - TASK-031
8. **OrientDB** (sqlengines/orientdb.py) - TASK-032

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Code Quality Assessment
- Check if implementations are complete or just stubs
- Verify all required methods are implemented (names, open, close, tables_query, views_query, fields_query)
- Assess error handling and connection management
- Check for proper logging and documentation

### 2. Protocol Compliance
- Verify adherence to established sqlengines patterns
- Check inheritance from appropriate base classes (Connection, TimeSeriesConnection, DocumentDatabaseConnection, etc.)
- Validate plugin registration mechanism
- Ensure consistency with other properly implemented engines

### 3. Requirements Verification
- Validate against expected interface requirements
- Check if driver dependencies are specified in requirements.txt
- Verify integration with main.py
- Assess authentication and security implementations

### 4. Technical Issues Identification
- Identify bugs or broken implementations
- Check for missing dependencies
- Assess architectural problems
- Identify performance or scalability concerns

### 5. Pattern Analysis
- Compare against established patterns in sqlengines/
- Identify which pattern each engine should follow
- Check for pattern violations or inconsistencies
- Assess if new patterns are needed

## Deliverables

1. **Comprehensive Audit Report** with:
   - Summary of findings for each engine
   - Severity assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Code quality score (1-10) for each implementation
   - Pattern compliance assessment

2. **Remediation Recommendations**:
   - Specific fixes needed for each engine
   - Priority ordering of fixes
   - Estimation of effort required
   - Whether re-implementation through dev-sqlengines is needed

3. **Pattern Compliance Matrix**:
   - Which pattern each engine should follow
   - Current compliance status
   - Gaps and missing components

4. **Technical Debt Assessment**:
   - Impact of non-compliance on system
   - Risk assessment for production use
   - Migration path recommendations

## Reference Materials

- Established patterns in sqlengines/ directory
- Properly implemented engines as reference (postgres.py, mysql_.py, clickhouse.py, etc.)
- Template files: _template.py.md and _template.sonet.py.md
- Memory Bank patterns/ and guides/ directories

## Success Criteria

- Complete analysis of all 8 implementations
- Clear identification of all issues and gaps
- Actionable recommendations for remediation
- Pattern compliance assessment for future development
